The solution is to add a class to the paragraph element and style that class. This increases specificity so the intended color is applied.

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

div p.special {
  color: red; /*This will override the parent's color*/
}
```
Now the paragraph with the class "special" will correctly have red text.
